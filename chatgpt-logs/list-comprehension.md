# Transform List to Requests

## You
Suppose you have the following function

create_filter_add_request(title, filter, color)

And the following class

class GTDContextLabel:
    name: str
    emojis: str
    color: str

    def generate_title(self):
        # returns a str

    def generate_filter(self):
        # returns a str

Now I have a list of context label objects, please transform that into a list of filter add requests

## ChatGPT
Certainly! To transform a list of `GTDContextLabel` objects into a list of filter add requests, you can iterate through the list and create requests using the provided function. Here's a Python code snippet to demonstrate:

```python
label_objects = [...]  # Your list of GTDContextLabel objects

filter_add_requests = []

for label_object in label_objects:
    title = label_object.generate_title()
    filter_str = label_object.generate_filter()
    color = label_object.color

    filter_add_request = create_filter_add_request(title, filter_str, color)
    filter_add_requests.append(filter_add_request)

```

This assumes that `create_filter_add_request` is a function that takes a title, filter string, and color as arguments and returns a filter add request. Make sure to replace `[...]` with your actual list of `GTDContextLabel` objects.

## You
Please use a list comprehension

## ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's the equivalent transformation using a list comprehension:

```python
label_objects = [...]  # Your list of GTDContextLabel objects

filter_add_requests = [
    create_filter_add_request(label.generate_title(), label.generate_filter(), label.color)
    for label in label_objects
]

```

This concise list comprehension achieves the same result as the previous code snippet.

## You
Create_filter_add_request returns dictionaries with an entry called args that is another dictionary. Please subsequently modify the resulting list so that each args contains an integer item_order corresponding to its 1-based index. Please use a lambda function that takes each object in the list and modifies the dictionary in the args key

## ChatGPT
Certainly! Assuming the structure of the dictionaries returned by `create_filter_add_request` looks something like this:

```python
# Sample structure of create_filter_add_request result
{
    'args': {
        # Other key-value pairs
    }
}

```

You can use a lambda function within a list comprehension to achieve this. Here's the modified code:

```python
label_objects = [...]  # Your list of GTDContextLabel objects

filter_add_requests = [
    lambda obj, idx=i: {'args': {**obj['args'], 'item_order': idx + 1}}
    for i, obj in enumerate([
        create_filter_add_request(label.generate_title(), label.generate_filter(), label.color)
        for label in label_objects
    ])
]

```

In this code, the lambda function takes an object and an index (`idx`). It then returns a modified dictionary with the additional `'item_order'` key, set to the 1-based index of the object in the list. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the object and its index during iteration.
